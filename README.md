Exploratory Data Analysis on White Wine Quality Using r

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a set of data for white wine. The set contained various chemical properties of the wine (e.g. pH, alcohol percentage, density etc.) and also an expert-judged quality measure for each wine, on a scale from 1 (poor) to 10 (outstanding). The R programming language was used to conduct the analysis.
